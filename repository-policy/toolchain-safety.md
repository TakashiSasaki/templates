# Preserve policy-toolchain safety boundaries

For policy-toolchain implementation paths that read or write a target repository, resolve paths against the repository root and reject escape through absolute paths, parent traversal, `.git`, or symbolic links. Do not silently overwrite repository files unless the tool can establish that the file is its own generated output.

Generated bootstrap material must never authorize execution through a mutable Git reference. Security-sensitive changes must preserve these boundaries in both positive and negative-path tests.
