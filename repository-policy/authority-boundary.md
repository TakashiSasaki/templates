# Preserve the policy-toolkit authority boundary

This branch is the development source for application-type-independent operating policy and its toolchain. Keep shared policy semantics in the shared `policy/` corpus and keep repository-maintainer rules in `repository-policy/`; do not place policy-repository maintenance requirements into the shared corpus merely because this repository consumes them.

Do not introduce Web application, Agent Skill, CLI-product, service, deployment-topology, surface, route, state, or other artifact-category architecture into the shared policy corpus. Artifact-specific contracts remain owned by their corresponding consumer branches or repositories.
